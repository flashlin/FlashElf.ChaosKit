# chaos-service
Chaos strategy is a software development strategy based on the chaos model. Its main rule is to always solve the most important problems first.

The most important issues include the three aspects of big, urgent and strong.

* The big problem provides users with function points.
* Urgent problems need to be solved urgently, otherwise other work may be delayed.
* Strong problems are considered trustworthy after being solved and tested, so that developers can safely look elsewhere.
